# Linear-Regression---Matlab

**This project was to learn how to implement Linear regression using Matlab.**

I used the automobile dataset, and the goal is to predict the MPG of a car.

I used Sochastic Gradient Descent to minimize the error of the algorithm.

I also used train_test_split to make sure I was not overfitting.
